          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p class="lead"> <a href='https://www.middlesexchildren.org/'>The Middlesex Coalition for Children</a> and <a href='http://earlychildhoodalliance.com/'>Connecticut Early Childhood Alliance.</a> has asked us to investigate the availability of child care for children 0-3 years old in each Connecticut town. We were able to create a choropleth map displaying childcare capacity per 100 children by town. The map allows us to see multi-town areas of deficits. These areas are defined as childcare deserts, where there is limited access to childcare in a town and its surrounding towns. This information is important to our community partners as identifying areas of deficits and specifically childcare deserts will give them and Connecticut families a comprehensive understanding of where families are struggling. Moreover, patterns across towns and relationships between capacity and median household income can help the Middlesex Coalition for Children and The Connecticut Early Childcare Alliance predict areas that need more support in developing childcare. Furthermore, we designed an interactive searchable table which will help our community partners and Hartford parents understand child care capacity in each town in Connecticut.</p>

          <h2>Findings</h2>
          <p>A cluster of towns in the mid-east section of Connecticut including Hampton, Scotland, Sprague, Brooklyn, Canterberry, Lisbon, Griswold, Plainfield and Sterling have a particularly high deficit in childcare capacity with all the towns having less than 25 childcare seats per 100 children.  This area can be considered a childcare desert. In this cluster of towns, there is a very small capacity for childcare. When towns with low capacity are clustered together it is called a childcare desert because there is not enough childcare available not only in a particular town but in the entire area. This means that in order for families to find childcare, they may need to look outside their immediate area and have the time, transportation, and financial resources to do so. These towns are a part of Windham County which is colloquially known as the “quiet corner”. These are rural towns that may not have the infrastructure, demand or resources for larger child care facilities. However, it is clear that urban areas experience a deficit as well.  

The top 5 biggest cities in Connecticut are in a childcare deficit. Hartford, New Haven, Waterbury, and Bridgeport have between 25 and 50 childcare seats available per 100 children. Stamford has the most capacity with a deficit of 64 seats per 100 children. Even in these areas that are very populated have deficits. This points to a systemic problem of an overall lack of childcare in the state that is not limited to just small or rural towns. Even in areas with a lot of infrastructure and demand, childcare capacity is lacking.</p>

          <h2>Methodology</h2>
          <p>Our first step was to clean the data imported from the CT Data database which has data on capacity for home and center childcare and youth camp. With the help of our instructor Jack, we cleaned the data then removed data regarding youth camp to focus just on childcare capacity. We then ensured that the towns were recorded in their official name by using GitHubs CTNameCleaner. Next, we created a new spreadsheet with the following information obtained from the data or from our calculations: Official Town names, Child Care Center Capacity for children ages 0-3, and Child Care Home Capacity for children ages 0-3, Total Capacity for Children in Child Care ages 0-3 (includes center and home), Children ages 0-5 (obtained from American Community Survey), Estimated Total Children ages 0-3, and Capacity per 100 Children. 
Official town names came from the cleaned data, along with center and home capacities. For home capacity it was noted that data includes children ages 6 and under. We did not have the exact number of seats open to children 0-3 since there are stipulations about how many infants are allowed with certain staffing ratios. To make a conservative calculation, we assumed that all the childcare slots in the home facilities could be open to children 0-3 years old. However, we can not be sure exactly how many of the slots are truly held by children ages 0-3 because of the limitations of the CT Data data. We are assuming the slots are open for 0-3 year olds in order to calculate the highest possible capacity.  From here, we created a new column to reflect the total capacity for both Center and Home using the sum formula. 
To obtain the total estimated population of children 0-3 years old per town in Connecticut, we downloaded census data from the Social Explorer database. From there, we were able to download census data from the American Community Survey 5-year Estimates (2017-2021) for children ages 0-5 for each town in Connecticut. We imported and cleaned the data and then used the V lookup tool to transpose the population data into the spreadsheet containing the childcare capacity data by town. Since the Social Explorer population data included children 0-5 years and the capacity data from CT Data Was for children 0-3 years old, we divided the population number by ⅗ to estimate the population of children 0-3 years old. In doing so, we assumed that there was an equal number of children of each age thus ⅗ of the population of children 0-5 years old would be a reasonable estimate of the population of children 0-3 years old. To find the childcare capacity of each town per 100 children we used the equation: (capacity/estimated population of children 0-3)*100. We decided to normalize the data this way to make it easier for the reader to understand our calculations. It is easy to visualize the capacity as the number of total childcare seats available for 100 children in each town. 
The data sourced from CT Data is not complete. Therefore, capacity data for the following towns is unavailable: Bozrah, Bridgewater, Colebrook, Eastford, Franklin, Goshen, Hartland, Morris, and Roxbury Union. These towns are grayed out and unlabeled on the map and interactive table because of the lack of data.</p>

          <p>Below are sample sentences with MLA inline citations that would appear in the body of the data story, followed by the full references that would appear in the bibliography at the bottom:</p>

          <h4>Sample sentences</h4>

          <p>The City of Hartford recently created a housing code that requires the registration of the full names and contact information for all owners of apartment buildings -- including the officers of Limited Liability Corporations (LLCs) -- in order to "close municipal loopholes that allow anonymous slumlords to operate unchecked" (Lurye).</p>

          <p>In most towns, the percentage of high-needs students enrolled in traditional public schools surpasses those enrolled in magnet, charter, and technical schools in the most recent academic year (“Resident Town Export”).</p>

          <p>...later, insert a bibliography at the end of your data story:</p>

          <h4>Works Cited:</h4>

          <p>Optional Hint: To display a clickable web link in the bibliography, look at the HTML code in GitHub for the examples above. See how the URL appears twice: once in the "href" and again in the display text. This is not required for your data story, but it looks good and helps readers to click and view your sources.</p>

          <h2>Conclusion: Advanced Tips</h2>

          <p>Change names of `Section 1` etc. to customized navigation labels that make sense for your data story, such as `Why It Matters` or `How We Made This` etc. To do this you must change names in TWO places: see the Navigation Container (around lines 30-50) and the corresponding Sections below. Keep the section numbers but change the reader-friendly labels.</p>

          <h4>Optional Subheaders: Use H4 tags to break up long sections</h4>

          <p>All of your data visualizations should be interactive. But if you need to insert a static image, you can upload a JPG or PNG to the GitHub repo, and insert it using the HTML img tag as shown below:</p>

          <img src="sample-image.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <p>Figure 2: Describe your image in a caption, and always credit the source if someone else created it.</p>

          <h4>Quickly Edit and View Changes on Your Local Computer</h4>

          <p>HINT: Instead of slowly making edits on GitHub, you can quickly make edits in your local computer and view them instantly in your browser. Here's a list of steps (in HTML format):
            <ol>
              <li>Go to your GitHub repo and select Code > Download Zip and uncompress the folder.</li>
              <li>Install a free code editor tool. My fav is <a href="https://atom.io">Atom Editor</a> but there are others, too.</li>
              <li>Open the "index.html" file with your code editor and make edits.</li>
              <li>In your browser, go to File > Open to view the "index.html" file that is on your local computer.</li>
              <li>After making some edits in the "index.html" file, save it, and refresh your browser to view changes. Most edits should appear right away.</li>
              <li>After making multiple edits on your local computer, carefully copy and paste the contents of "index.html" in your online GitHub account, and test your published updates online.
            </ol>
          </p>

          <h4>Two Options for Tables</h4>

          <p>If you need to create a table, first try the Datawrapper Tables tool -- see <a href='https://handsondataviz.org/table.html'>HODV Chapter 8</a> -- and embed the results like this:</p>

          <iframe title="Table 1: Suburbs Offer a Small Percentage of Their Seats to Hartford Open Choice Students " aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-Qrb7J" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Qrb7J/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="972"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
          </script>

          <p>Table 1: Add your standalone caption here.</p>

          <p>A second option is to use the <a href="https://www.tablesgenerator.com/html_tables">Tables Generator HTML tool</a>. Go to File > Import or manually enter your table data, then Generate the HTML code, and paste it here, similar to this sample: </p>

          <style type="text/css">
